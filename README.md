# Something Cornish

This firmware intent to replace the ["original" firmware](https://github.com/a741725193/zmk-config-zen-2) that's powering the corne clone found on Aliexpress which is using a 52840nano controller.

The original firmware is a large copy paste of the Corn-ish Zen source code, with some tweak to enable the underglow.

As the main source code for corn-ish zen is now merged into ZMK, it's time for a cleanup.
